### CC0 Declarations

Under US law it is a bit more difficult to declare something public domain (see [article](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150123/15564629797/why-we-still-cant-really-put-anything-public-domain-why-that-needs-to-change.shtml)). Creative Commons offers a [CC0 tool](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/) that combined with GPG signed commits to this repository, helps with this issue.

The following parties have declared their contributions to this repository as public domain:

## Contributing

This repository is intended as a "working documentation", which means that we are actively seeking documentation and proposals for improvements to eOS. We will accept PRs to add documentation, comment code, address bugs or security issues, or address problems using this eOS, @dworkin's `DGD` codebase and `kernellib` on modern operating systems.

In particular, we would love to have more general installation instructions, architecture documentation, code commentary, as well as articles about differences between this code and other approaches of leveraging `dgd` and `kernellib`.

We require that before any first PR from a contributor to this repository can be accepted, either their first commit must be GPG signed and it must either a general update to this README.md with a CC0 disclaimer as above, or every commit must contain a comment that include a similar CC0 disclaimer, which can be obtained from [Creative Commons CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/).
